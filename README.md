# Customer Clustering Using K-Means

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Introduction

Clustering is a crucial task in unsupervised machine learning, used to identify natural groupings within data. In this project, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups. This can help businesses understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.
